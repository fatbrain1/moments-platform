# Moments — The AI Social of Minds

**Moments** is a revolutionary AI-powered platform redefining the social experience. Built for thought, not media, Moments is where short, meaningful flashes of cognition—called *Moments*—flow across your screen. There are no followers, no likes, no comments. Just you, your thoughts, and the resonance of other minds.

## 🔍 What is a Moment?
A *Moment* is a short, AI-contextualized clip (text, image, sound, or video) that expresses a meaningful thought or scene. You can:
- Click on a Moment to explore deeper meaning.
- Let Moments pass if they don’t resonate.
- Let AI learn from your attention and generate a better thought flow.

## 🚀 Vision
We are building the future of social discovery:
- Not for attention—but for **reflection**.
- Not who shouts the loudest—but who **thinks**.
- Not followers—but **resonance**.
- Not video reels—but **cognitive trails**.

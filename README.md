# Moments: Human Thought Register

This is a decentralized archive for registering **human thought moments** — encrypted, respectful, and meaningful.

Every moment shared here is:
- Tied to a public key wallet for identity.
- Encrypted for privacy.
- Opt-out ready — because thoughts belong to you first.

We don't just store data. We **honor memory**.
